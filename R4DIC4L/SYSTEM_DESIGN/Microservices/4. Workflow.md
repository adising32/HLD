#### Database Transactions

##### Two Phase Commits
The 2PC is broken into two phases (hence the name two-phase commit) a voting phase and a commit phase.
-  During the **voting phase**, a central coordinator contacts all the workers who are going to be part of the transaction and asks for confirmation as to whether or not some state change can be made. If all workers agree that the state change they are asked for can take place, the algorithm proceeds to the next phase.

- If all workers agreed to make the change, we move to the **commit phase**. Here, the changes are actually made, and associated locks are released.


##### SAGA
Unlike a two-phase commit, a saga is by design an algorithm that can coordinate multiple changes in state, but avoids the need for locking resources for long periods of time. A saga does this by modeling the steps involved as discrete activities that can be executed independently. For failure handling, there are two types of recovery: **backward recovery** and **forward recovery**. Backward recovery involves reverting the failure and cleaning up afterwards—a roll‐ back. For this to work, we need to define **compensating actions** that allow us to undo previously committed transactions. Forward recovery allows us to pick up from the point where the failure occurred and keep processing. For that to work, we need to be able to **retry transactions**.

###### Orchestrated sagas
Orchestrated sagas use a central coordinator known as **orchestrator**. Orchestrated sagas are a command-and-control approach: the orchestrator controls what happens and when, and with that comes a good degree of visibility into what is happening with any given saga. Examples of implementation are  Business process modeling (BPM) tools like Camunda and Zeebe.

###### Choreographed sagas
A choreographed saga aims to distribute responsibility for the operation of the saga among multiple collaborating services. Choreographed sagas represent a trust-but-verify architecture.
