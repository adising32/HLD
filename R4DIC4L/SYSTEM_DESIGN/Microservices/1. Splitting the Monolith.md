##### Advantages of Microservices
- Technology Heterogenity
- Robustness 
- Scaling
- Ease of Deployment
- Ease of managing Dev Teams
- Reusability of components by outside components

##### Microservices Pain Points
- Developers need to simultaneously run many applications for debugging
- Technology overload
- Cost
- Reporting is difficult as data is scattered into multiple databases
- More data is transfered over the network hence security is a concern
- Monitoring is difficult
- Data consistency needs to be handled at the Application Layer

#### Strangler Fig Pattern
Intercept calls to the existing monolithic application. If the call to that piece of functionality is implemented in the new microservice architecture, it is redirected to the microservice. If the functionality is still provided by the monolith, the call is allowed to continue to the monolith itself.

##### Optimizations
- Feature toggle can be developed to turn on and off the microservice flows
- Parallel requests can be made to both microservices and monolith and data can be compared for correctness.


#### Concerns with Data Decomposition

##### Performance
Since few functionalities of databases like joins will be pulled from the Database Layer to Application layer, it will impact the performance.
##### Data Integrity
Foreign Keys and Cascading features will have to be handled in the Application Layer which can cause data integrity issues.
##### Transactions
It is difficult to implement distributed transactions.
