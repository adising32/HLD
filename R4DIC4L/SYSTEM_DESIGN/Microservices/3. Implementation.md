#### Architectural styles for microservice communications

##### Remote Procedure calls (RPC)
Remote procedure call (RPC) refers to the technique of making a local call and having it execute on a remote service somewhere. Examples are **Simple Object Access Protocol**,  **gRPC**, **Java RMI**. Most of the technology in this space requires an explicit schema.
##### Representational State Transfer (REST)
REST provides a set of guidelines for creating scalable, stateless, and resource-oriented APIs.
##### GraphQL
it makes it possible for a client-side device to define queries that can avoid the need to make multiple requests to retrieve the same information.

##### Message Brokers
Message brokers are intermediaries, often called middleware, that sit between pro‚Äê cesses to manage communication between them.

#### Serialisation formats

##### Binary
**Protocol Buffers** (often abbreviated as **protobufs**) are a method developed by Google for serializing structured data.
**Key features** :
- Compact and Efficient
- Defined schema
- Cross-platform support
- Versioning support
Used when worried about payload size or about the efficiencies of writing and reading the payloads.

##### Text
REST APIs most often use a textual format for the request and response bodies. JSON has usurped XML as the text serialisation format of choice.
