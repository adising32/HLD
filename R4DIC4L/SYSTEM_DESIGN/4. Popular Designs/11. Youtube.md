#### Video Uploading flow

#### Video Streaming flow
**Protocols** 
- MPEG–DASH. MPEG stands for “Moving Picture Experts Group” and DASH stands for "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP".
- Apple HLS. HLS stands for “HTTP Live Streaming”.
- Microsoft Smooth Streaming.
- Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS).
Videos are streamed from CDN directly. The edge server closest to user will deliver the video.

#### Optimisations and Safety

**Chunking**
Uploading a video as a whole unit is inefficient. We can split a video into smaller chunks.This allows fast resumable uploads when the previous upload failed. The job of splitting a video file by GOP can be implemented by the client to improve the upload speed.

**Closer Upload Centres**
Multiple upload centers across the globe closer to users.

**Pre signed Urls**
A **pre-signed URL** is a URL that grants temporary, secure access to a resource in cloud storage (like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage).
The URL includes a cryptographic signature that validates the permissions and expiration time, ensuring that access is only available as configured. 
This can be used by client to directly access the S3 storage instead of going through the server.

**Cost Optimisation**
- Only use CDNs for popular content. Rest can be served from data centres. 
- Distribute videos over CDN region wise based on popularity.
- Skip encoding to all formats for less popular content. 
- Short videos can be encoded on demand.
