### Goal
Design a unique ID generator with the below properties
- Ids must be unique
- IDs are numerical values only
- IDs fit into 64-bit
- IDs are ordered by date
- Ability to generate over 10,000 unique IDs per second


### Approaches

#### Multi-master replication
This approach uses the databasesâ€™ auto_increment feature. Instead of increasing the next ID by 1, we increase it by k, where k is the number of database servers in use.
Has some major drawbacks:
- Hard to scale with multiple data centers  
- IDs do not go up with time across multiple servers.  
- It does not scale well when a server is added or remove

#### UUID
A UUID is another easy way to obtain unique IDs. UUID is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. UUID has a very low probability of getting collusion.

**Pros** 
- Generating UUID is simple. No coordination between servers is needed so there will not be any synchronization issues.
- The system is easy to scale because each web server is responsible for generating IDs they consume. ID generator can easily scale with web servers.
**Cons** 
- IDs are 128 bits long, but our requirement is 64 bits. 
- IDs do not go up with time.  
- IDs could be non-numeric.

#### Ticket Server
The idea is to use a centralized auto_increment feature in a single database server
**Pros**
- Numeric IDs.  
- It is easy to implement, and it works for small to medium-scale applications.
**Cons**
- Single point of failure.

#### Twitter snowflake approach

- Sign bit: 1 bit. It will always be 0. This is reserved for future uses. It can potentially be used to distinguish between signed and unsigned numbers.
- Timestamp: 41 bits. 
- Datacenter ID: 5 bits
- Machine ID: 5 bits
- Sequence number: 12 bits. For every ID generated on that machine/process, the sequence number is incremented by 1. The number is reset to 0 every millisecond.

The most important 41 bits make up the timestamp section. As timestamps grow with time, IDs are sortable by time.The maximum timestamp that can be represented in 41 bits is  2 ^ 41 - 1 = 2199023255551 milliseconds (ms), which gives us: ~ 69 years = 2199023255551 ms / 1000 seconds / 365 days / 24 hours/ 3600 seconds. This means the ID generator will work for 69 years

We assume ID generation servers have the same clock. This assumption might not be true when a server is running on multiple cores. The same challenge exists in multi-machine scenarios. Network Time Protocol is the most popular solution to this problem.
