### Requirements
- A user can publish a post and see her friends’ posts on the news feed page.
- Feed is sorted by reverse chronological order.
- 5000 friends
- 10 million Daily Active Users
- Contain media files, including both images and videos.


### Feed Publishing
When a user publishes a post, corresponding data is written into cache and database. A post is populated to her friends’ news feed.
##### News Feed Publishing API
```
POST /v1/me/feed
Params:  
- content: content is the text of the post.
- auth_token: it is used to authenticate API requests.
```

##### Fanout service
Fanout is the process of delivering a post to all friends. Two types of fanout models are:
###### Fanout on write
With this approach, news feed is pre-computed during write time. A new post is delivered to friends’ cache immediately after it is published.
**Pros**:  
- The news feed is generated in real-time and can be pushed to friends immediately.  
- Fetching news feed is fast because the news feed is pre-computed during write time.
**Cons**:
- If a user has many friends, fetching the friend list and generating news feeds for all of them are slow and time consuming. It is called hotkey problem.
- For inactive users or those rarely log in, pre-computing news feeds waste computing resources.

###### Fanout on read
The news feed is generated during read time. This is an on-demand model. Recent posts are pulled when a user loads her home page.
**Pros**:
- For inactive users or those who rarely log in, fanout on read works better because it will not waste computing resources on them.
- Data is not pushed to friends so there is no hotkey problem.
**Cons**:  
- Fetching the news feed is slow as the news feed is not pre-computed.

###### Hybrid Approach
Since fetching the news feed fast is crucial, we use a push model for the majority of users. For celebrities or users who have many friends/followers, we let followers pull news content on-demand to avoid system overload.
