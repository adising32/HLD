### GOAL
A key-value storage with below properties:
- The size of a key-value pair is small: less than 10 KB.  
-  Ability to store big data.  
-  High availability: The system responds quickly, even during failures.  
-  High scalability: The system can be scaled to support large data set.  -  Automatic scaling: The addition/deletion of  servers should be automatic based on traffic. â€¢ Tuneable consistency.  
-  Low latency.

#### Data Partition
Split the data into smaller partitions and store them in multiple servers. Distribute data across multiple servers evenly. Minimize data movement when nodes are added or removed. Consistent Hashing is used to achieve this.

#### Data Replication
To achieve high availability and reliability, data must be replicated asynchronously over N servers. After a key is mapped to a position on the hash ring, walk clockwise from that position and choose the first N servers on the ring to store data copies. For better reliability, replicas are placed in distinct data centers, and data centers are connected through high-speed networks.

#### Consistency
Quorum consensus can guarantee consistency for both read and write operations.
- N = The number of replicas  
- W = A write quorum of size W. For a write operation to be considered as successful, write operation must be acknowledged from W replicas.  
- R = A read quorum of size R. For a read operation to be considered as successful, read operation must wait for responses from at least R replicas.

**Tuning the above parameters**
- If R = 1 and W = N, the system is optimized for a fast read.
- If W = 1 and R = N, the system is optimized for fast write.
- If W + R > N, strong consistency is guaranteed (Usually N = 3, W = R = 2).
- If W + R <= N, strong consistency is not guaranteed.
