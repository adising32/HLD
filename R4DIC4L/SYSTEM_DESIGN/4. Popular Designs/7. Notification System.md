#### Goals
- Push notification, SMS message, and email.
- iOS devices, android devices, and laptop/desktop.
- Users who choose to opt-out will no longer receive notifications.
- 10 million mobile push notifications, 1 million SMS messages, and 5 million emails.

#### Different types of notifications

##### iOS push notification

- **Provider** : A provider builds and sends notification requests to Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). To construct a push notification, the provider provides the following data
	- Device token: This is a unique identifier used for sending push notifications.
	- Payload: This is a JSON dictionary that contains a notificationâ€™s payload.

- **APNS** : This is a remote service provided by Apple to propagate push notifications to iOS devices.
- **iOS Device** : It is the end client, which receives push notifications


##### Android push notification
Instead of using APNs, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is commonly used

##### SMS
For SMS messages, third party SMS services like Twilio, Nexmo, and many others are commonly used.
##### Email
Sendgrid and Mailchimp  are among the most popular email services, which offer a better delivery rate and data analytics.


#### Contact info gathering flow

#### Notification sending/receiving flow

##### Reliability
Persists notification data in a database and implements a retry mechanism. When a notification event first arrives, we check if it is seen before by checking the event ID. If it is seen before, it is discarded. Otherwise, we will send out the notification.
##### Notification Templates
Notification templates are introduced to avoid building every notification from scratch.

##### Notification setting
Before any notification is sent to a user, we first check if a user is opted-in to receive this type of notification in a notification settings table.

##### Rate limit
To avoid overwhelming users with too many notifications, we can limit the number of notifications a user can receive.

##### Retry
When a third-party service fails to send a notification, the notification will be added to the message queue for retrying. If the problem persists, an alert will be sent out to developers.

##### Monitoring
A key metric to monitor is the total number of queued notifications. If the number is large, the notification events are not processed fast enough by workers. To avoid delay in the notification delivery, more workers are needed.

##### Events Tracking
Notification metrics, such as open rate, click rate, and engagement are important in understanding customer behaviors. Analytics service implements events tracking.


#### Final Design
