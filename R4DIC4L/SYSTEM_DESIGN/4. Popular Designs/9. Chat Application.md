#### Requirements
- One on One chat
- Group chat, max 100 members
- 50 million daily active users
- Text and images 
- Multi device support

#### Client Server Connection

##### Service Discovery
The primary role of service discovery is to recommend the best chat server for a client based on the criteria like geographical location, server capacity, etc. Apache Zookeeper is a popular open-source solution for service discovery. It registers all the available chat servers and picks the best chat server for a client based on predefined criteria.
##### Web Sockets
WebSocket connection is initiated by the client. It is bi-directional and persistent. Through this persistent connection, a server could send updates to a client.
##### Chat Servers
Client maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to a chat server for real-time messaging. 
##### Presence Servers
Presence servers manage online/offline status.

#### High Level Design![[chat-server.png]]

##### Storage
Key-value stores like Hbase and Cassandra
- Key-value stores allow easy horizontal scaling.  
- Key-value stores provide very low latency to access data.
- Relational databases do not handle long tail of data well. When the indexes grow large, random access is expensive.\
##### message_table
```
message_id (bigint) (PK)
message_from (bigint)
message_to (bigint)
content (text)
created_at (timestamp)
```

##### group_message_table
```
channel_id (bigint) (PK)
message_id (bigint) (PK)
user_id (bigint)
content (text)
created_at(timestamp)
```

#### Message Id Generator
To maintain message sequence, message id generator should generate unique incrementing message ids. This can be unique in a group as sequence is only necessary within the group or one-on-one chat.

#### 1-on-1 message flow

#### Group Message flow

#### Message synchronization across multiple devices
Each device maintains a variable called cur_max_message_id, which keeps track of the latest message ID on the device. Messages that satisfy the following two conditions are considered as news messages:
- The recipient ID is equal to the currently logged-in user ID.  
- Message ID in the key-value store is larger than cur_max_message_id.

#### Online Presence
Periodically, an online client sends a heartbeat event to presence servers. If presence servers receive a heartbeat event within a certain time, say x seconds from the client, a user is considered as online. Otherwise, it is offline.
