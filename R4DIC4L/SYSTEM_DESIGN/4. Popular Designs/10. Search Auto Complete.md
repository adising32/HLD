#### Requirements
- Match only at the beginning of a search query.
- No, spell check or autocorrect is not supported.
- 10 million DAU.
- Fast response time
- Results returned by the system must be sorted by popularity or other ranking models.
- Scalable and Highly available

### Design

#### Trie
To store data Trie data structure is used. At each node, top k words are cached for faster retrieval. In order to accommodate huge amount of data, we shard the trie based on prefixes onto multiple nodes.
**Create** : Trie is created by workers using aggregated data. The source of data is from Analytics Log/DB.
**Update** : 
- Option 1: Update the trie weekly. Once a new trie is created, the new trie replaces the old one.
- Option 2: Update individual trie node directly.
**Delete** : We add a filter layer (Figure 13-14) in front of the Trie Cache to filter out unwanted suggestions.

#### Data gathering service
**Analytics Logs** : It stores raw data about search queries. Logs are append-only and are not indexed.
**Aggregators** : Data is aggregated periodically as required
**Workers** : Periodically push data to Trie database

**Trie Database**
Trie DB is the persistent storage. Two options are available to store the data:
- Document store: Since a new trie is built weekly, we can periodically take a snapshot of it, serialize it, and store the serialized data in the database. Document stores like MongoDB are good fits for serialized data.
- Key-value store: A trie can be represented in a hash table form by applying the following logic:
	- Every prefix in the trie is mapped to a key in a hash table.
	- Data on each trie node is mapped to a value in a hash table.
