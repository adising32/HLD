### Goal
Design a URL shortener that has the below characteristics:  
- URL shortening: given a long URL => return a much shorter URL 
- URL redirecting: given a shorter URL => redirect to the original URL 
- High availability, scalability, and fault tolerance considerations
- 100 million URLs are generated per day.

#### Estimation
- Write operation: 100 million URLs are generated per day. • Write operation per second: 100 million / 24 /3600 = 1160
- Read operation: Assuming ratio of read operation to write operation is 10:1, read operation per second: 1160 * 10 = 11,600
- Assuming the URL shortener service will run for 10 years, this means we must support 100 million * 365 * 10 = 365 billion records.
- Assume average URL length is 100.
- Storage requirement over 10 years: 365 billion * 100 bytes * 10 years = 365 TB

#### API Endpoints

- API to shorten a given URL
```
POST api/v1/data/shorten
request parameter: {longUrl: longURLString}


- return shortURL
```

- API to **redirect** to long url
```
GET api/v1/shortUrl


- Return longURL for HTTP redirection
```

##### URL Redirecting

- **301 redirect**. A 301 redirect shows that the requested URL is “permanently” moved to the long URL. Since it is permanently redirected, the browser caches the response, and subsequent requests for the same URL will not be sent to the URL shortening service. Instead, requests are redirected to the long URL server directly.

- **302 redirect**. A 302 redirect means that the URL is “temporarily” moved to the long URL, meaning that subsequent requests for the same URL will be sent to the URL shortening service first. Then, they are redirected to the long URL server.


##### Hashing
Hash function is used to hash a long URL to a short URL, also known as hashValue.
- **Hash value length** : The hashValue consists of characters from [0-9, a-z, A-Z], containing 10 + 26 + 26 = 62 possible characters. To figure out the length of hashValue, find the smallest n such that 62^n ≥ 365 billion. When n = 7, 62 ^ n = ~3.5 trillion
- **Hash Function** : 
	- Use pre defined Hash functions like SHA, MD5, CRC etc. 
	- Or use the Id and convert it to base 62.
- **Collision Resolution** : Every time a new hash is generated, we need to check in our database if it is already in use. This is required only if we generate random hashes as in the case of predefined hash functions. In case of incremental unique ids, this can be skipped. If the hash exists then we append a pre defined string to the input and pass it to the hash function.
