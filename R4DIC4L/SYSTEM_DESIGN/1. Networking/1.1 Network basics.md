>Protocol
   A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.


Computer Networks follow a layered architecture. Each protocol belongs to one of the layers. Each layer provides its service by (1) performing certain actions within that layer and by (2) using the services of the layer directly below it.

| Layer       | Entity    | Example                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Application | Message   | HTTP, <br>FTP, <br>SMTP     | Here the network applications and their application-layer protocols reside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Transport   | Segment   | TCP, <br>UDP                | Transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In TCP which is connection oriented, first handshaking happens on a pre defined welcome port, then for each client a new port is opened for that specific client. In UDP, there is no handshaking and client just sends message to server worrying about delivery.            |
| Network     | Datagrams | IP                          | Responsible for moves datagrams from one host to another. Transport Layer passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Link        | Frames    | Ethernet, WiFi              | Network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the  link layer. Network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route |
| Physical    | Bits      | Twisted Pair, Optical Fiber | Move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. Examples are not really protocols but mediums for which protocols are built.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Application Layer

There are two types of application architecture w.r.t. networking. Client-Server and Peer-to-peer
#### Client Server Architecture
![[client-server.png]]

In a client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients. Another characteristic of the client-server architecture is that the server has a fixed, well-known address, called an IP address. 
Often in a client-server application, a single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients. For this reason, a data center, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server.
Examples : Web, FTP, Telnet

#### P2P Architecture

![[peer-to-peer.png]]
In a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centres.  Instead the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers. The peers are not owned by the service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops controlled by users. Example : bit torrent

#### Communication

Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network. A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket. A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API). 

![[application-layer.png]]
To identify the receiving process, two pieces of information need to be specified: 
1. the address of the host (IP Address)
2. an identifier that specifies the receiving process in the destination host (Port)

#### Studying Application Layer protocols

##### HTTP
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Web’s application-layer protocol, defines the structure of messages and how the client and server exchange the messages. HTTP communication is ***stateless***. The default mode of HTTP uses ***persistent connections*** (introduced in Http 1.1) which means the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response. Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection. HTTP runs on TCP.

Typical HTTP request message :

```
GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.someschool.edu
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept-language: fr
```

The first line of an HTTP request message is called the request line; the subsequent lines are called the header lines. The request line has three fields: the method field, the URL field, and the HTTP version field. 

Typical HTTP response message : 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:44:04 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:11:03 GMT
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html

(data data data data data ...)
```

The status line has three fields: the protocol version field, a status code, and a corresponding status message.

When a server receives a request with the ***HEAD*** method, it responds with an HTTP message but it leaves out the requested object. Used fro debugging.

***Cookies*** can be used to create a user session layer on top of stateless HTTP. When responding to a client request, the server creates a unique identification number and creates an entry in its back- end database that is indexed by the identification number. 

Header added in response : 
```
Set-cookie: 1678
```

The client upon receiving this response then appends a line to the special cookie file that it manages. This line includes the hostname of the server and the identification number in the Set-cookie: header. This is then added to subsequent requests.

Header added to subsequent requests : 
```
Cookie: 1678
```

A ***Web cache*** —also called a proxy server—is a network entity that satisfies HTTP requests on the behalf of an origin Web server. The Web cache has its own disk storage and keeps copies of recently requested objects in this storage. A CDN company installs many geographically distributed caches throughout the Internet, thereby localising much of the traffic. There are shared CDNs (such as Akamai and Limelight) and dedicated CDNs (such as Google and Netflix).

An HTTP request message is a so-called ***conditional GET*** message if 
1. the request message uses the GET method and 
2. the request message includes an If-Modified-Since: header line.

```
GET /fruit/kiwi.gif HTTP/1.1
Host: www.exotiquecuisine.com
If-modified-since: Wed, 9 Sep 2015 09:23:24
```

Objects in web cache might be stale. So it does a up-to-date check from time to time  by issuing a conditional GET. If object is not modified the response does not contain the requested object and has a status code of 304.

```
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Date: Sat, 10 Oct 2015 15:39:29
Server: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)

(empty entity body)
```


##### SMTP


![[email.png]]

Sample communication between client mail server (C) and server mail server(S). First a TCP connection is setup. Then the below commands execute

```
S:  220 hamburger.edu
C:  HELO crepes.fr
S:  250 Hello crepes.fr, pleased to meet you
C:  MAIL FROM: <alice@crepes.fr>
S:  250 alice@crepes.fr ... Sender ok
C:  RCPT TO: <bob@hamburger.edu>
S:  250 bob@hamburger.edu ... Recipient ok
C:  DATA
S:  354 Enter mail, end with ”.” on a line by itself
C:  Do you like ketchup?
C:  How about pickles?
C:  .
S:  250 Message accepted for delivery
C:  QUIT
S:  221 hamburger.edu closing connection
```

SMTP requires each message, including the body of each message, to be in 7-bit ASCII format.  ***Post Office Protocol—Version 3 (POP3), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), and HTTP*** are some protocols for transferring mails from a mailbox present in a mail server to local PC. SMTP runs on TCP.

##### DNS (Domain Name System)

The DNS is 
1. a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and
2. an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database.
It runs on UDP. It is used to translate hostnames to IP addresses.


##### P2P (Peer to Peer)

***BitTorrent*** is used for p2p file sharing. Here's how it works:
When a peer (Alice) joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs the tracker that it is still in the torrent. the tracker randomly selects a subset of peers (for concreteness, say 50) from the set of participating peers, and sends the IP addresses of these 50 peers to Alice. Possessing this list of peers, Alice attempts to establish concurrent TCP connections with all the peers on this list. Periodically, Alice will ask each of her neighboring peers (over the TCP connections) for the list of the chunks they have. If Alice has L different neighbors, she will obtain L lists of chunks. With this knowledge, Alice will issue requests (again over the TCP connections) for chunks she currently does not have. Alice will have two important decisions to make. First, which chunks should she request first from her neighbors? And second, to which of her neighbors should she send requested chunks? In deciding which chunks to request, Alice uses a technique called rarest first. Alice gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying her data at the highest rate.

##### HTTP Streaming And DASH ( Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

In HTTP streaming, the video is simply stored at an HTTP server as an ordinary file with a specific URL. When a user wants to see the video, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server and issues an HTTP GET request for that URL. The server then sends the video file, within an HTTP response message, as quickly as the underlying network protocols and traffic conditions will allow. On the client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer. Once the number of bytes in this buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold, the client application begins playback—specifically, the streaming video application periodically grabs video frames from the client application buffer, decompresses the frames, and displays them on the user’s screen.
Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). In DASH, the video is encoded into several different versions, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level. The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate versions. The client selects different chunks one at a time with HTTP GET request messages.

##### CDN (Content Deliver Network)
In order to meet the challenge of distributing massive amounts of video data to users distributed around the world, almost all major video-streaming companies make use of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). A CDN manages servers in multiple geographically distributed locations, stores copies of the videos (and other types of Web content, including documents, images, and audio) in its servers, and attempts to direct each user request to a CDN location that will provide the best user experience.

##### WebSocket

WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP which starts from ***ws://*** or **wss://**. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will stay alive until it gets terminated by either party (client or server)
