UML stands for Unified Modelling language

#### Types
##### Structural UML diagrams

###### 1. Class diagram 
A class diagram describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system. Multiplicity indicates how many instances of a class participate in the relationship.

Different types of relationship between classes: 
- **Association** : If two classes in a model need to communicate with each other, there must be a link between them, and an association can represent that. By default associations are always assumed to be bi-directional. Eg Pilot and FlightInstance.
- **Aggregation** : Aggregation is a special type of association used to model a “whole to its parts” relationship. Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Eg Aircraft can exist without Airline.
- **Composition** : The composition aggregation relationship is just another form of the aggregation relationship, but the child class’s instance lifecycle is dependent on the parent class’s instance lifecycle. Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Eg WeeklySchedule is composed in Flight.
- **Generalization** : Generalization is a mechanism for combining similar classes of objects into a single, more general class. Eg Crew, Pilot, and Admin, all are Person.

##### Behavioral UML diagrams
###### 1. Use case diagram
Use case diagrams describe a set of actions (called use cases) that a system should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (called actors).

###### 2. Activity diagram
An activity diagram shows the flow of control or object flow with emphasis on the condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens.

###### 3. Sequence diagram
Sequence diagrams describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time.
