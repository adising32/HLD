#### Steps to do LLD
- **Identify inheritance** : For eg. In Library Management System, a BookItem class inherits an abstract Book class. Similarly Admin and Member both extend Account class.
- **Identify interfaces** :  For eg. In Parking Lot, ParkingSlot can be an interface and 2WheelerParkingSlot, 4WheelerParkingSlot can be implementations which can then define their parking rates.
- **Identify Actors and Use cases** : 
- **Identify which classes a particular entity is composed/aggregated of** : For eg ParkingFloor consists of ParkingSlot and ParkingSlot has a Vehicle.
