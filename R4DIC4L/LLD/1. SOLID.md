The **SOLID principles** are five key guidelines in object-oriented programming and design that help developers create maintainable, scalable, and robust software.

##### 1. Single Responsibility
A class should have only one reason to change.

Eg : Instead of a single `Invoice` class handling both invoice calculation and printing, split it into:
    - `InvoiceCalculator` for calculations.
    - `InvoicePrinter` for printing.

##### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Eg : Adding new features to a payment processing system by creating new subclasses (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`) rather than modifying the base `PaymentProcessor` class.

##### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Eg : If `Bird` is a base class, and `Penguin` is a subclass, ensure `Penguin` doesn't break expectations (e.g., overriding a `fly()` method inappropriately).

##### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
Eg : Instead of a single IWorker interface with methods like Work() and Eat(), create:
- IWorkable with Work().
- IEatable with Eat().

##### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Eg :  Use an interface like `ILogger` to abstract logging functionality, and let concrete implementations like `FileLogger` or `DatabaseLogger` implement the interface. High-level classes depend on `ILogger`, not the specific logger.
