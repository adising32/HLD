| Feature         | Factory Method                                      | Abstract Factory                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Define a method for creating a single product.      | Define methods for creating related products.                       |
| **Flexibility** | Focused on creating one product type.               | Creates families of related products.                               |
| **Complexity**  | Simpler than Abstract Factory.                      | More complex, involves multiple product types.                      |
| **Example**     | `ShapeFactory.createShape("circle");`               | `ShapeFactory.create2DShape();` and `ShapeFactory.create3DShape();` |
|                 | `Shape circle = new CircleFactory().createShape();` | `ShapeFactory factory = new CircleAndSphereFactory();`              |
