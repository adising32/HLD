When we need to have multiple combinations from base and decorator such as Base1 with Decorator2 and Decorator3 etc. we can use decorator pattern as Decorator3(Decorator2(Base1)). We need not create multiple classes for each combination.
Here the Decorator interface holds an object of Base and itself is also a Base.
