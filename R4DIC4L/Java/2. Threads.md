#### Process
Process is an instance of a program that is getting executed.

#### Thread
Smallest sequence of instructions which can be executed by CPU independently.

**Code Segment** : Contains compiled byte code. It is read only. All threads share the same code segment.
**Data Segment** : Contains global and static variables. 
**Heap** : Objects created in runtime using **new** keyword.
**Stack** : Manages method calls and local variables.
**Registers** : Used for optimizing machine code and context switching.
**Counter** : Program counter points to the instruction getting executed.

| **Thread State**      | **Description**                                                                                      | **Releases Object Locks?**                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **NEW**               | Thread is created but has not yet started (`start()` not called).                                    | Not applicable                                |
| **RUNNABLE**          | Thread is running or ready to run, waiting for CPU time.                                             | No (still holds locks, if any were acquired)  |
| **BLOCKED**           | Thread is waiting to acquire an intrinsic lock (e.g., due to `synchronized` block/method).           | Yes (does not hold lock it is waiting for)    |
| **WAITING**           | Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action (`wait()`, `join()`). | Yes (releases any acquired locks)             |
| **TIMED_WAITING**     | Thread is waiting for a specified amount of time (`sleep()`, `wait(timeout)`, `join(timeout)`).       | Yes (releases any acquired locks)             |
| **TERMINATED**        | Thread has completed execution.                                                                      | Yes                                           |

#### Thread Methods

| **Method**               | **Description**                                                                                                 | **Where to Use**                             | **Releases Lock?** | **Throws Exception?**               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **`wait()`**             | Causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object.    | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | Yes                | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`wait(long timeout)`** | Similar to `wait()`, but waits for the specified time in milliseconds, then resumes if not notified sooner.     | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | Yes                | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`notify()`**           | Wakes up one random thread that is waiting on the same object's monitor.                                        | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | No                 | None                                |
| **`notifyAll()`**        | Wakes up all threads waiting on the same object's monitor. Only one thread proceeds after reacquiring the lock. | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | No                 | None                                |
| **`join()`**             | Makes the current thread wait until the specified thread completes execution.                                   | From any thread, on another thread           | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`join(long timeout)`** | Waits for the specified time in milliseconds for the specified thread to complete, then resumes if still alive. | From any thread, on another thread           | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`sleep(long millis)`** | Pauses the current thread for the specified time in milliseconds, releasing CPU but not locks.                  | Inside any code, often to simulate delays    | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`yield()`**            | Hints to the thread scheduler to pause the current thread and let other threads execute (not guaranteed).       | Inside any code, used to improve performance | No                 | None                                |
| **`interrupt()`**        | Signals that the current thread or another thread should stop or be interrupted if waiting or sleeping.         | From one thread to interrupt another         | No                 | None (but may set interrupted flag) |


#### Types of Threads

|**Thread Type**|**Description**|**Key Characteristics**|
|---|---|---|
|**User Threads**|Threads that perform main tasks and keep the JVM running.|JVM waits for completion before exiting|
|**Daemon Threads**|Background service threads that terminate when all user threads finish.|Automatically stopped when JVM exits|
|**Main Thread**|Initial thread created by JVM to execute `main()` method.|Acts as the entry point of the Java program|
|**Worker Threads**|Threads from a thread pool, managed by `ExecutorService` for efficient task handling.|Reusable, managed threads for resource efficiency|

#### Thread Local
Every thread has a ThreadLocal variable, which we can use to store thread level values. Only one object of ThreadLocal will work with all threads. While using thread pools we need to clear these values as values from previous tasks might be stored.

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ThreadLocalMapExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Map<String, String>> threadLocalMap = ThreadLocal.withInitial(HashMap::new);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            Map<String, String> map = threadLocalMap.get();
            map.put("thread1-key", "thread1-value");
            System.out.println("Thread 1 Map: " + map);
            threadLocalMap.remove();  // Clear the thread-local value
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            Map<String, String> map = threadLocalMap.get();
            map.put("thread2-key", "thread2-value");
            System.out.println("Thread 2 Map: " + map);
            threadLocalMap.remove();  // Clear the thread-local value
        };

        executor.submit(task1);
        executor.submit(task2);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Java Async Thread Contructs

##### Future
The `Future` interface represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Has methods like isDone(), cancel() etc.

##### Callable
The `Callable` interface is similar to `Runnable`, but it can return a result and throw checked exceptions. It is what we submit to a thread pool or run asynchronously.

##### Completable Future
`CompletableFuture` is a more advanced and flexible alternative to `Future`.  
It has methods like `runAsync() or supplyAsync()` for submitting jobs.
It supports methods like `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()`, `thenRun()`, `thenCombine()`, etc., for composing multiple asynchronous tasks.
