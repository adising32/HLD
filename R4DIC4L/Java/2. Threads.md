#### Process
Process is an instance of a program that is getting executed.

#### Thread
Smallest sequence of instructions which can be executed by CPU independently.

**Code Segment** : Contains compiled byte code. It is read only. All threads share the same code segment.
**Data Segment** : Contains global and static variables. 
**Heap** : Objects created in runtime using **new** keyword.
**Stack** : Manages method calls and local variables.
**Registers** : Used for optimizing machine code and context switching.
**Counter** : Program counter points to the instruction getting executed.

| **Thread State**      | **Description**                                                                                      | **Releases Object Locks?**                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **NEW**               | Thread is created but has not yet started (`start()` not called).                                    | Not applicable                                |
| **RUNNABLE**          | Thread is running or ready to run, waiting for CPU time.                                             | No (still holds locks, if any were acquired)  |
| **BLOCKED**           | Thread is waiting to acquire an intrinsic lock (e.g., due to `synchronized` block/method).           | Yes (does not hold lock it is waiting for)    |
| **WAITING**           | Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action (`wait()`, `join()`). | Yes (releases any acquired locks)             |
| **TIMED_WAITING**     | Thread is waiting for a specified amount of time (`sleep()`, `wait(timeout)`, `join(timeout)`).       | Yes (releases any acquired locks)             |
| **TERMINATED**        | Thread has completed execution.                                                                      | Yes                                           |

#### Thread Methods

| **Method**               | **Description**                                                                                                 | **Where to Use**                             | **Releases Lock?** | **Throws Exception?**               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **`wait()`**             | Causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object.    | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | Yes                | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`wait(long timeout)`** | Similar to `wait()`, but waits for the specified time in milliseconds, then resumes if not notified sooner.     | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | Yes                | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`notify()`**           | Wakes up one random thread that is waiting on the same object's monitor.                                        | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | No                 | None                                |
| **`notifyAll()`**        | Wakes up all threads waiting on the same object's monitor. Only one thread proceeds after reacquiring the lock. | Inside a `synchronized` block on the object  | No                 | None                                |
| **`join()`**             | Makes the current thread wait until the specified thread completes execution.                                   | From any thread, on another thread           | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`join(long timeout)`** | Waits for the specified time in milliseconds for the specified thread to complete, then resumes if still alive. | From any thread, on another thread           | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`sleep(long millis)`** | Pauses the current thread for the specified time in milliseconds, releasing CPU but not locks.                  | Inside any code, often to simulate delays    | No                 | `InterruptedException`              |
| **`yield()`**            | Hints to the thread scheduler to pause the current thread and let other threads execute (not guaranteed).       | Inside any code, used to improve performance | No                 | None                                |
| **`interrupt()`**        | Signals that the current thread or another thread should stop or be interrupted if waiting or sleeping.         | From one thread to interrupt another         | No                 | None (but may set interrupted flag) |


#### Types of Threads

|**Thread Type**|**Description**|**Key Characteristics**|
|---|---|---|
|**User Threads**|Threads that perform main tasks and keep the JVM running.|JVM waits for completion before exiting|
|**Daemon Threads**|Background service threads that terminate when all user threads finish.|Automatically stopped when JVM exits|
|**Main Thread**|Initial thread created by JVM to execute `main()` method.|Acts as the entry point of the Java program|
|**Worker Threads**|Threads from a thread pool, managed by `ExecutorService` for efficient task handling.|Reusable, managed threads for resource efficiency|
