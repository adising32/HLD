Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. An in use object, or a referenced object, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused object, or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed.

**Marking** : This is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not.

**Deletion** : Normal deletion removes unreferenced objects leaving referenced objects and pointers to free space.

**Compaction** : To further improve performance, in addition to deleting unreferenced objects, you can also compact the remaining referenced objects. By moving referenced object together, this makes new memory allocation much easier and faster.

##### JVM Generations

Java Heap is divided into multiple generations.

| **Generation**           | **Purpose**                                                                         | **Garbage Collection Type** | **Stop the World Event** | **Characteristics**                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Young Generation**     | Holds newly allocated and short-lived objects.                                      | Minor GC                    | Yes                      | Optimized for a high object mortality rate, allowing quick collection. Surviving objects are promoted to the Old Generation.            |
| **Old Generation**       | Stores long-lived objects that have survived multiple young generation collections. | Major GC                    | Yes                      | Collection is slower due to the large number of live objects. Stop the World events for major GC can affect application responsiveness. |
| **Permanent Generation** | Contains metadata for classes and methods needed by the JVM.                        | Full GC                     | Yes                      | Populated at runtime with class and method information. Classes may be unloaded to free space if no longer needed.                      |

As of Java 8, Permanent generation is removed and Metaspace is used which is expandable and is part of native memory and not JVM heap.

#### Garbage collection flow
- First, any new objects are allocated to the eden space. Both survivor spaces start out empty.
- When the eden space fills up, a minor garbage collection is triggered.
- Referenced objects are moved to the first survivor space. Unreferenced objects are deleted when the eden space is cleared.
- At the next minor GC, the same thing happens for the eden space. Unreferenced objects are deleted and referenced objects are moved to a survivor space. However, in this case, they are moved to the second survivor space (S1). In addition, objects from the last minor GC on the first survivor space (S0) have their age incremented and get moved to S1.
- Once all surviving objects have been moved to S1, both S0 and eden are cleared.
- At the next minor GC, the same process repeats. However this time the survivor spaces switch. Referenced objects are moved to S0. Surviving objects are aged. Eden and S1 are cleared.
- After a minor GC, when aged objects reach a certain age threshold (8 in this example) they are promoted from young generation to old generation. As minor GCs continue to occur objects will continue to be promoted to the old generation space.
- Eventually, a major GC will be performed on the old generation which cleans up and compacts that space.


#### Different Types of Collectors]


##### Common switches
| **Switch**      | **Description**                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| -Xms            | Sets the initial heap size for when the JVM starts. |
| -Xmx            | Sets the maximum heap size.                         |
| -Xmn            | Sets the size of the Young Generation.              |
| -XX:PermSize    | Sets the starting size of the Permanent Generation. |
| -XX:MaxPermSize | Sets the maximum size of the Permanent Generation   |

##### Serial GC 
With the serial collector, both minor and major garbage collections are done serially (using a single virtual CPU)
It uses a mark-compact collection method. This method moves older memory to the beginning of the heap so that new memory allocations are made into a single continuous chunk of memory at the end of the heap.
Used on applications that do not have low pause time requirements. Or where high number of JVMs are run on the same machine.
To enable :  `-XX:+UseSerialGC`

##### Parallel GC
The parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the young generation garbage collection. By default the number of threads equals number of CPUs on that machine. Used when a lot of work need to be done and long pauses are acceptable.
Switches : 
 `-XX:+UseParallelGC` : a multi-thread young generation collector with a single-threaded old generation collector and single-threaded compaction of old generation.
 `-XX:+UseParallelOldGC` : a multithreaded young generation collector and multithreaded old generation collector and  also a multithreaded compacting collector.

##### Concurrent Mark Sweep Collector
The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector (also referred to as the concurrent low pause collector) collects the tenured generation. It attempts to minimize the pauses due to garbage collection by doing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads. A garbage collection is done without moving the live objects. CMS collector on young generation uses the same algorithm as that of the parallel collector. Used for applications that require low pause times and can share resources with the garbage collector.

To enable the CMS Collector :   `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`  
and to set the number of threads :  `-XX:ParallelCMSThreads=<n>`


##### Garbage First GC (G1GC)
Designed to optimise garbage collection for applications with large heap sizes (several gigabytes and above) and provide predictable pause times. G1GC divides the heap into equal-sized regions, typically around 1 to 32 MB each, instead of traditional generation-based divisions (like young and old generations).
- **Young regions**: Hold recently allocated objects.
- **Old regions**: Hold long-lived objects.
- **Humongous regions**: Hold very large objects (greater than half the region size) that don't fit into typical regions.
G1GC allows you to specify a target pause time goal (e.g., `200ms`), which it tries to meet by controlling the amount of work done in each GC cycle.
