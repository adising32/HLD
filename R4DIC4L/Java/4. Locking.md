#### Types of locks
##### Intrinsic Locks
These are implicit locks provided by Java, associated with every object. They are automatically used when we use `synchronized` methods or blocks. Also known as monitor locks. It locks a particular object.
```
public synchronized void myMethod() { ... }
// or
synchronized (this) { ... }

```

##### Explicit Locks
These are locks that allow explicit acquisition and release control. They are used when we need to acquire locks on a particular piece of execution which are being executed from multiple objects. 
###### Reentrant Lock
```
class X {
   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...

   public void m() {
     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
     try {
       // ... method body
     } finally {
       lock.unlock()
     }
   }
```

###### ReadWrite Lock
A ReadWriteLock maintains a pair of associated locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive.
```
class CachedData {
   Object data;
   volatile boolean cacheValid;
   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

   void processCachedData() {
     rwl.readLock().lock();
     if (!cacheValid) {
        // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
        rwl.readLock().unlock();
        rwl.writeLock().lock();
        try {
          // Recheck state because another thread might have
          // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
          if (!cacheValid) {
            data = ...
            cacheValid = true;
          }
          // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
          rwl.readLock().lock();
        } finally {
          rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
        }
     }

     try {
       use(data);
     } finally {
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
     }
   }
 }
```

###### Stamped Lock
Has the same functionality as ReadWrite locks. It additionally supports an optimistic read functionality.
```
double distanceFromOrigin() { // A read-only method
     long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
     double currentX = x, currentY = y;
     if (!sl.validate(stamp)) {
        stamp = sl.readLock();
        try {
          currentX = x;
          currentY = y;
        } finally {
           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
        }
     }
     return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);
   }
```


###### Semaphore lock
Allows more than one thread to access a piece of execution.
```
class Pool {
   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
     available.acquire();
     return getNextAvailableItem();
   }

   public void putItem(Object x) {
     if (markAsUnused(x))
       available.release();
   }

```

#### await(), signal(), signalAll(), Condition
Equivalent to wait(), notify(), notifyAll(). But here the threads wait on a Condition object. 

```
public class MessageQueue<T> {
 
    private Queue<T> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private Condition hasMessages = lock.newCondition();
 
    public void publish(T message) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            queue.offer(message);
            hasMessages.signal(); 
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
 
    public T receive() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                hasMessages.await();
            }
            return queue.poll();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
 
}
```


### Lock Free Concurrency
##### CAS : Compare and Swap
The basic idea of CAS is to atomically compare the current value of a variable with an expected value and, if they match, replace it with a new value. If the comparison fails, the operation is not performed, and the current value is returned.
Arguments are : Memory location, Expected Value, New Value

Can be used for simple atomic thread safe operations. Examples are **AtomicInteger**, **AtomicBoolean** etc.
These classes use volatile variables. **Volatile** variables are fields which refer directly to memory skipping any intermediate caches like L1, L2. This makes sure that all updates to it are immediately visible to all threads.

In databases versioning is used to maintain data consistency without locking also known as Optimistic concurrency control. CAS is used to increment the version.

##### ABA Problem
Memory location initial value: 10
Thread 1 changed to : 11
Thread 2 changed back to: 10
This is ABA problem as the current value is not the initial value. If this needs to be avoided, we need to use stamps or versions with each value. In java **AtomicStampedReference** can be used.
