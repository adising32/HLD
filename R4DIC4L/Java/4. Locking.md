#### Types of locks
##### Intrinsic Locks
These are implicit locks provided by Java, associated with every object. They are automatically used when we use `synchronized` methods or blocks. Also known as monitor locks. It locks a particular object.
```
public synchronized void myMethod() { ... }
// or
synchronized (this) { ... }

```

##### Explicit Locks
These are locks that allow explicit acquisition and release control. They are used when we need to acquire locks on a particular piece of execution which are being executed from multiple objects. 
###### Reentrant Lock
```
class X {
   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...

   public void m() {
     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
     try {
       // ... method body
     } finally {
       lock.unlock()
     }
   }
```

###### ReadWrite Lock
A ReadWriteLock maintains a pair of associated locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive.
```
class CachedData {
   Object data;
   volatile boolean cacheValid;
   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

   void processCachedData() {
     rwl.readLock().lock();
     if (!cacheValid) {
        // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
        rwl.readLock().unlock();
        rwl.writeLock().lock();
        try {
          // Recheck state because another thread might have
          // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
          if (!cacheValid) {
            data = ...
            cacheValid = true;
          }
          // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
          rwl.readLock().lock();
        } finally {
          rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
        }
     }

     try {
       use(data);
     } finally {
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
     }
   }
 }
```

###### Stamped Lock
Has the same functionality as ReadWrite locks. It additionally supports an optimistic read functionality.
```
double distanceFromOrigin() { // A read-only method
     long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
     double currentX = x, currentY = y;
     if (!sl.validate(stamp)) {
        stamp = sl.readLock();
        try {
          currentX = x;
          currentY = y;
        } finally {
           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
        }
     }
     return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);
   }
```


###### Semaphore lock
Allows more than one thread to access a piece of execution.
```
class Pool {
   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
     available.acquire();
     return getNextAvailableItem();
   }

   public void putItem(Object x) {
     if (markAsUnused(x))
       available.release();
   }

```

#### await(), signal(), signalAll(), Condition
Equivalent to wait(), notify(), notifyAll(). But here the threads wait on a Condition object. 

```
public class MessageQueue<T> {
 
    private Queue<T> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private Condition hasMessages = lock.newCondition();
 
    public void publish(T message) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            queue.offer(message);
            hasMessages.signal(); 
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
 
    public T receive() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                hasMessages.await();
            }
            return queue.poll();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
 
}
```
