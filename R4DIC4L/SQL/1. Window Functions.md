This window function assigns value (row number) to each row based on a column order defined by order by clause. The row number value can be grouped according to column defined in partition by clause. Here each row has a distinct row number even if column value is same.

##### RANK()
Same as above but if column value matches row number is same and the next rank is skipped w.r.t. no of duplicates.
